This budget app (in progress) was made via Python and the Tkinter library to improve the experience for budget and expense divisions for individuals or a group of people (i.e. roommates)

As of now, only the base GUI for several pages including the home and sign-in/sign-up pages as well as the sign-in/account functionality (using SQLite) have been implemented.
